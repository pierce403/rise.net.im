# Chat Dump

chat dump

I've been thinking like, a chat app where people can list their available resources in a tab in the group chat. The process for requesting a checkout would be built into the app. Each item would have the original owner, current physical location, and a log of who checked it out. I want to do a sort of point system where people can build up reputation over time in the various community chats they're in, but that's not even needed if the chats are close-knit enough.

I was also kind of thinking "nextdoor but good"

By default these groups would be invite only, and if would be very clear who invited who. Besides direct invites, people could leave QR code invites in their mailbox or other community spaces. There is a fun way to leech directly off Nextdoor's existing social graph if I wanted to go that route too.

I would want to limit communities to about 150 people, but anyone can join any number of communities.

I also want to have a tab that's like a community craigslist, with lists of jobs that need to be done around the community and people offering their skills, and maybe something for community meal prep where people can make and share food with each other, and a place where people can request assistance.
